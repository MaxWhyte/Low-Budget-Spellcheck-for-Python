# Low-Budget Spellcheck for Python
A simple Spellcheck which compares input from a csv file with another dictionary csv file which serves as a whitelist. This notebook helped me save a few minutes every day when translating a lot of text for a client from english to german.

To do: 
1. automate process with a button in Jupyter Notebook
2. fix umlaut-issue when writing csv files (pandas might help?)
3. compare speed of sets vs lists
4. check if numbers in translation are correct
5. check if no spaces before comma
6. check if X is in target when Y is in source
